        <p>
            My name is Duncan Carr. I'm a freshman Mathematics major at Bradley University.
            In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with friends, collaborating on side-projects,
            and trying new things.

            Recently, I've become more and more interested in photography and graphic design. This past
            year, I received <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/support/p/eos-m5">a camera (Canon EOS M5)</a> and I have
            since started trying to figure out how to take pictures by photographing friends and
            nature. My interest in graphic design manifested by my creation and management of a
            post-high-school-graduation <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sluh.2023/">Instagram account (@sluh.2023)</a>,
            where I showcased students' post grad plans. I learned how to use Adobe Illustrator to create
            graphics and learned strategies for different layouts.

                In collaboration with another Bradley student, I help to create a website that displays laundry information
                of all the different locations around campus. This website utilizes vanilla HTML, JS, and CSS.

                I took pictures of a friend with my camera, playing around with custom camera settings to try
                and get good shots. Additionally, I utilized Adobe Lightroom to edit the photos.

                Handled surveying information from students and used Adobe Illustrator to create each post's graphic. I learned

                This Behance project contains random pictures taken with my camera after I got it. I learned more about how
